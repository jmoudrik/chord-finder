# Chord Finder CLI

A command-line Python tool that generates playable chord fingerings for fretted string instruments (e.g. guitar, ukulele) based on a given tuning.  
Instead of exhaustively listing every possible shape, it uses heuristics to suggest fingerings that are ergonomic and practical to play.
